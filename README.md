# Landing Page Project


## Introduction
This is The Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree's second project (FEND). This project aims to build a multi-section landing page with a navigational menu that will be dynamically updated depending on how much information is added to the pageâ€”additionally indicating as "active" the portion that is visible to users at the moment. Last but not least, when selecting the associated nav list item from the navbar menu with the "to top" button, the page scrolls to the top.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
